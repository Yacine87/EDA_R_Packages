# EDA_R_Packages
EDA is a must to step in the data science workflow. Working on data, wrangling &amp; transforming them is time consuming, and it determine the success degree of the next steps (pre preocessing, modelling, communicating outputs &amp; decision making). This repo will show you how to perform EDA in R using the tidyverse ecosystem, and will introduce a comparative approach between the main packages in R whcich could let you perform automated EDA &amp; generating automated EDA html or pdf reports, ready to be communicated.  

# Scope of work 
We are going to compare here the most known (in my awareness) R packages dedicated to EDA & automated EDA.

Here is a non exhaustive list: 
The tidyverse: the most known & revolutionary packages' ecosystem (collection of packages) in R. Covering all the DS workflow. ## See https://www.tidyverse.org/
Note that the above packages have dependencies with the tidyverse's package as dplyr, ggplot2, etc.
